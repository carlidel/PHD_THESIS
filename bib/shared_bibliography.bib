  abstract  = {It is already known (Froeschl{\'e} et al., 1997a) that the fast Lyapunov indicator (hereafter FLI), i.e. the computation on a relatively short time of a quantity related to the largest Lyapunov indicator, allows us to discriminate between ordered and weak chaotic motion. Using the FLI many results have been obtained on the standard map taken as a model problem. On this model we are not only able to discriminate between a short time weak chaotic motion and an ordered one, but also among regular motion between non resonant and resonant orbits. Moreover, periodic orbits are characterised by constant FLI values which appear to be related to the order of periodic orbits (Lega and Froeschl{\'e}, 2001). In the present paper we extend all these results to the case of continuous dynamical systems (the H{\'e}non and Heiles system and the restricted three-body problem). Especially for the periodic orbits we need to introduce a new value: the orthogonal FLI in order to fully recover the results obtained for mappings.}

  abstract  = {Recognition and extraction of features in a nonparametric density estimate are highly dependent on correct calibration. The data-driven choice of bandwidth h in kernel density estimation is a difficult one that is compounded by the fact that the globally optimal h is not generally optimal for all values of x. In recognition of this fact a new type of graphical tool, the mode tree, is proposed. The basic mode tree plot relates the locations of modes in density estimates with the bandwidths of those estimates. Additional information can be included on the plot indicating factors such as the size of modes, how modes split, and the locations of antimodes and bumps. The use of a mode tree in adaptive multimodality investigations is proposed, and an example is given to show the value in using a normal kernel, as opposed to the biweight or other kernels, in such investigations. Examples of such investigations are provided for Ahrens's chondrite data and van Winkle's Hidalgo stamp data. Finally, the bivariate mode tree is introduced, together with an example using Scott's lipid data.}

  abstract = {The paper confronts chaos indicators of two basic types: spectral methods and variational methods. The spectral methods include the spectral numbers and the integrated autocorrelation function. Variational methods discussed are FLI, MEGNO and OFLI2. Using an ad hoc model of coupled pendulum we demonstrate various spurious patterns that appear in the maps of the chaos indicators. Spectral methods generate spurious Moiré fringes, whereas variational methods are sensitive to the integration time or – in the case of the first-order variations indicators – to the initial direction of the variations vector. An example of major discrepancy between the two kinds of methods is given for an unstable periodic orbit. The influence of the initial variations vector is explained in the context of Lyapunov vectors theory and some selection rules are recommended.}

  abstract  = {During the last decades the Nonlinear Dynamics field has produced a large number of numerical techniques oriented to the analysis of the behavior of the orbits in different systems. These methods are mainly focused to distinguish chaotic from regular behavior. Among the variational methods, based into the variational equations, we discuss in this paper the so-called Orthogonal Fast Lyapunov Indicator (OFLI and OFLI2) methods that are variants of the FLI method but designed to obtain also some information about the periodic orbits of the systems. We review the OFLI and OFLI2 methods and we show several computational aspects related with avoiding the appearance of spurious structures, with their use in the analysis of regular/chaotic behaviors, but also with the analysis of periodic orbits and regular regions, and with the efficient computation of the solution of the variational equations by means of Taylor series methods. Finally, the methods are shown in several Hamiltonian problems, as well as in several classical dissipative systems, as the Lorenz and R{\"o}ssler models.}

  abstract = {One of the main functions of the {LHC} beam loss measurement system is the protection of equipment against damage caused by impacting particles creating secondary showers and their energy dissipation in the matter. Reliability requirements are scaled according to the acceptable consequences and the frequency of particle impact events on equipment. Increasing reliability often leads to more complex systems. The downside of complexity is a reduction of availability; therefore, an optimum has to be found for these conflicting requirements. A detailed review of selected concepts and solutions for the {LHC} system will be given to show approaches used in various parts of the system from the sensors, signal processing, and software implementations to the requirements for operation and documentation.}

It is a fast indicator that provides a clear picture of the resonance structure, the location of stable and unstable periodic orbits as well as a measure of hyperbolicity in chaotic domains which coincides with that given by the maximum Lyapunov characteristic exponent but in a shorter evolution time.

Convergence of the time average to the space average is slow. We use a modified average of by giving very small weights to the ‘end’ terms when n is near 0 or . When is a trajectory on a quasiperiodic torus and f and T are , our weighted Birkhoff average (denoted ) converges ‘super’ fast to with respect to the number of iterates N, i.e. with error decaying faster than for every integer m. Our goal is to show that our weighted Birkhoff average is a powerful computational tool, and this paper illustrates its use for several examples where the quasiperiodic set is one or two dimensional. In particular, we compute rotation numbers and conjugacies (i.e. changes of variables) and their Fourier series, often with 30-digit accuracy.}

But that convergence can be slow. Instead of uniform averages that assign equal weights to points along the trajectory, we use an average with a non-uniform distribution of weights, weighting the early and late points of the trajectory much less than those near the midpoint . We show that in quasiperiodic dynamical systems, our weighted averages converge far faster provided f is sufficiently differentiable. This result can be applied to obtain efficient numerical computation of rotation numbers, invariant densities and conjugacies of quasiperiodic systems.}

  abstract      = {In response to the 2013 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study was launched, as an international collaboration hosted by CERN. This study covers a highest-luminosity high-energy lepton collider (FCC-ee) and an energy-frontier hadron collider (FCC-hh), which could, successively, be installed in the same 100 km tunnel. The scientific capabilities of the integrated FCC programme would serve the worldwide community throughout the 21st century. The FCC study also investigates an LHC energy upgrade, using FCC-hh technology. This document constitutes the second volume of the FCC Conceptual Design Report, devoted to the electron-positron collider FCC-ee. After summarizing the physics discovery opportunities, it presents the accelerator design, performance reach, a staged operation scenario, the underlying technologies, civil engineering, technical infrastructure, and an implementation plan. FCC-ee can be built with today's technology. Most of the FCC-ee infrastructure could be reused for FCC-hh. Combining concepts from past and present lepton colliders and adding a few novel elements, the FCC-ee design promises outstandingly high luminosity. This will make the FCC-ee a unique precision instrument to study the heaviest known particles (Z, W and H bosons and the top quark), offering great direct and indirect sensitivity to new physics.},

  abstract      = {Particle physics has arrived at an important moment of its history. The discovery of the Higgs boson has completed the Standard Model, the core theory behind the known set of elementary particles and fundamental interactions. However, the Standard Model leaves important questions unanswered, such as the nature of dark matter, the origin of the matter--antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, and the existence and hierarchy of neutrino masses. To address these questions and the origin of the newly discovered Higgs boson, high-energy colliders are required. Future generations of such machines must be versatile, as broad and powerful as possible with a capacity of unprecedented precision, sensitivity and energy reach. Here, we argue that the Future Circular Colliders offer unique opportunities, and discuss their physics motivation, key measurements, accelerator strategy, research and development status, and technical challenges. The Future Circular Collider integrated programme foresees operation in two stages: initially an electron--positron collider serving as a Higgs and electroweak factory running at different centre-of-mass energies, followed by a proton--proton collider at a collision energy of 100 TeV. The interplay between measurements at the two collider stages underscores the synergy of their physics potentials.},

  abstract      = {The beam aperture of a particle accelerator defines the clearance available for the circulating beams and is a parameter of paramount importance for the accelerator performance. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the knowledge and control of the available aperture is crucial because the nominal proton beams carry an energy of 362 MJ stored in a superconducting environment. Even a tiny fraction of beam losses could quench the superconducting magnets or cause severe material damage. Furthermore, in a circular collider, the performance in terms of peak luminosity depends to a large extent on the aperture of the inner triplet quadrupoles, which are used to focus the beams at the interaction points. In the LHC, this aperture represents the smallest aperture at top-energy with squeezed beams and determines the maximum potential reach of the peak luminosity. Beam-based aperture measurements in these conditions are difficult and challenging. In this paper, we present different methods that have been developed over the years for precise beam-based aperture measurements in the LHC, highlighting applications and results that contributed to boost the operational LHC performance in Run 1 (2010--2013) and Run 2 (2015--2018)},

  abstract      = {Crossing the transition energy is always a delicate process, representing a potential source of strong perturbations of the dynamics of charged particle beams in a hadron circular accelerator. Since the first generation of multi-GeV rings, intense studies have been devoted to understanding the possible harmful mechanisms involved in transition crossing and to devise mitigation measures. Nowadays, several circular particle accelerators are successfully operating across the transition energy and this process is well mastered. In a completely different context, stable resonances of the traverse phase space have been proposed as new means of manipulating charged particle beams. While the original aim of such a proposal was multi-turn extraction from the CERN Proton Synchrotron to the Super Proton Synchrotron, many more applications have been proposed and studied in detail. In this paper, the two topics, i.e. transition crossing and stable resonances, have been brought together with the goal of providing a novel and non-adiabatic approach to perform a clean transition crossing. The idea presented here is that by judiciously using sextupoles and octupoles it is possible to generate stable islands of the horizontal phase space. These islands represent a second closed orbit whose properties can be selected independently of those of the standard, i.e. central, closed orbit. This provides a means of performing a non-adiabatic change of the transition energy experienced by the charged particles by displacing the beam between the two closed orbits.},

  abstract  = {The Nekhoroshev theorem has provided in the last decades an important framework to study the long-term stability of quasi-integrable dynamical systems. While KAM theorem predicts the stability of invariant tori for non--resonant motions, the Nekhoroshev theorem provides exponential stability estimates for resonant motions. The ?rst part of this chapter reviews the mechanisms which are at the basis of the proof of Nekhoroshev theorem.},

Symplectic particle tracking simulations are required to optimize the efficiency and study potentially undesired beam dynamics effects with the HELs. With the relevant time scales in the collider in the order of several minutes, tracking simulations require considerable computing resources. A new tracking tool, Xsuite, developed at CERN since 2021, offers the possibility of performing such tracking simulations using graphics processing units (GPUs), with promising perspectives for the simulation of hadron beam dynamics with HELs. In this contribution, we present the implementation of HEL physics effects in the new tracking framework. We compare the performance with previous tools and show simulation results obtained using known and newly established simulation setups.}}

  abstract  = {{In recent years, nonlinear effects have been used to modify the transverse beam distribution by crossing nonlinear resonances adiabatically. This allows generating transversally split beams, in which the initial single Gaussian is divided into several ones depending on the order and stability type of the resonance used. Nonlinear effects could be used to try and cool a beam by acting on its transverse beam distribution. In this paper, we present and discuss the special case of a beam with an annular distribution, showing how the resulting emittance could be reduced by means of nonlinear effects.}}

A familiar mechanism causing nonhyperbolicity is the tangency of the stable and unstable manifolds at points on the chaotic set. Here we investigate a different mechanism that can lead to nonhyperbolicity in typical invertible (respectively noninvertible) maps of dimension 3 (respectively 2) and higher. In particular, we investigate a situation (first considered by Abraham and Smale in 1970 for different purposes) in which the dimension of the unstable (and stable) tangent spaces are not constant over the chaotic set; we call this unstable dimension variability. A simple two-dimensional map that displays behavior typical of this phenomenon is presented and analyzed.},

  abstract   = {The existing CERN accelerator infrastructure is world unique and its research capacity should be fully exploited. In the coming decade its principal modus operandi will be focused on producing intense proton beams, accelerating and colliding them at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with the highest achievable luminosity. This activity should, in our view, be complemented by new initiatives and their feasibility studies targeted on re-using the existing CERN accelerator complex in novel ways that were not conceived when the machines were designed. They should provide attractive, ready-to-implement research options for the forthcoming paradigm-shift phase of the CERN research. This paper presents one of the case studies of the Gamma Factory initiative (Krasny, 2015) -- a proposal of a new operation scheme of ion beams in the CERN accelerator complex. Its goal is to extend the scope and precision of the LHC-based research by complementing the proton--proton collision programme with the high-luminosity nucleus--nucleus one. Its numerous physics highlights include studies of the exclusive Higgs-boson production in photon--photon collisions and precision measurements of the electroweak (EW) parameters. There are two principal ways to increase the LHC luminosity which do not require an upgrade of the CERN injectors: (1) modification of the beam-collision optics and (2) reduction of the transverse emittance of the colliding beams. The former scheme is employed by the ongoing high-luminosity (HL-LHC) project. The latter one, applicable only to ion beams, is proposed in this paper. It is based on laser cooling of bunches of partially stripped ions at the SPS flat-top energy. For isoscalar calcium beams, which fulfil the present beam-operation constrains and which are particularly attractive for the EW physics, the transverse beam emittance can be reduced by a factor of 5 within the 8 seconds long cooling phase. The predicted nucleon--nucleon luminosity of LNN=4.2×1034s−1cm−2 for collisions of the cooled calcium beams at the LHC top energy is comparable to the levelled luminosity for the HL-LHC proton--proton collisions, but with reduced pile-up background. The scheme proposed in this paper, if confirmed by the future Gamma Factory proof-of-principle experiment, could be implemented at CERN with minor infrastructure investments.},

  abstract  = {In the last 20 years numerical experiments have allowed to study dynamical systems in a new way providing interesting results. The development of tools for the detection of regular and chaotic orbits has been one of the key points to access the global properties of dynamical systems. In many cases the visualization of suitably chosen sections of the phase space has been determinant for the comprehension of the fascinating and complex interplay between order and chaos. The Fast Lyapunov Indicator introduced in Froeschl{\'e} et al. (Celest Mech Dyn Astron 67:41--62, 1997) and further developed in Guzzo et al. (Physica D 163(1--2):1--25, 2002), is an easy to implement and sensitive tool for the detection of order and chaos in dynamical systems. Closely related to the computation of the Largest Lyapunov Exponent, the Fast Lyapunov Indicator relies on the idea that the computation of tangent vectors contains a lot of information even on short integration times, while for the Largest Lyapunov Indicator large integration times are required in order to accurately approximate a limit value. The aim of this Chapter is to provide the definition of the Fast Lyapunov indicator and some simple examples of applications for readers that would like to implement and use the indicator for the first time. We associate to each example of application the references to more specific papers that we have published during these years.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to extend adiabatic invariance theorems to all orders in the slowness parameter. The concept of adiabatic invariance to all orders is formulated precisely in Section I. In Section II, a classical one-dimensional nonlinear oscillator is treated. It is proved that the action integral extended over a period of the instantaneous time independent problem is an adiabatic invariant to all orders. Section III is devoted to the extension of the Born-Fock quantum mechanical adiabatic theorem to all orders. The systems to which the proof applies in all rigor are those which have a finite number of nondegenerate quantum states which do not cross in the process of adiabatic change. The proofs are based on a systematic construction of the asymptotic expansion in the slowness parameter of the statistical distribution function which describes an initially stationary ensemble of systems.}

  abstract = {A fast dynamic aperture (DA) optimization method for storage rings has been developed through the use of reversal integration. Even if dynamical systems have an exact reversal symmetry, a numerical forward integration differs from its reversal. For a chaotic trajectory, cumulative round-off errors are scaled, which results in an exponential growth on the difference. The exponential effect is a generic chaos indicator which represents the sensitivity of the chaotic motion to its initial condition. The chaos indicator of the charged particle motion can be obtained by comparing the forward integrations of particle trajectories with corresponding reversals, a.k.a. “backward integrations.” The indicator is observable even through short-term particle tracking simulations. Therefore, adopting it as an objective function could speed up optimization. The DA of the National Synchrotron Light Source II storage ring, and another test diffraction-limited light source ring, were optimized using this method for the purpose of demonstration.}

It is stable in the sense that if the function belongs to a family of functions depending smoothly on a finite-dimensional parameter, then the estimate will be correct for functions with close parameter values. Related to this estimate is a stratification of the space of jets of functions; the strata are semialgebraic sets of increasing codimension.  Bibliography: 6 items.}

The strength of the dipolar magnetic field is a function of the machine radius, beam energy, and of the fraction of the ring circumference that can be filled with dipoles. In this paper, we propose to use a combined-function periodic cell to maximise the filling factor of the dipole magnets. The optical properties of the proposed periodic structure are discussed in detail together with the design of the superconducting magnets needed to implement the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {We use the Reversibility Error Method and the Fidelity to analyze the global effects of a small perturbation in a non-integrable system. Both methods have already been proposed and used in the literature but the aim of this paper is to compare them in a physically significant example adding some considerations on the equivalence, observed in this case, between round-off and random perturbations. As a paradigmatic example we adopt the restricted planar circular three body problem. The cumulative effect of random perturbations or round-off leads to a divergence of the perturbed orbit from the reference one. Rather than computing the distance of the perturbed orbit from the reference one, after a given number n of iterations, a procedure we name the Forward Error Method (FEM), we measure the distance of the reversed orbit (n periods forward and backward) from the initial point. This approach, that we name Reversibility Error Method (REM), does not require the computation of the unperturbed map. The loss of memory of the perturbed map is quantified by the Fidelity decay rate whose computation requires a statistical average over an invariant region. Two distinct definitions of Fidelity are given. The asymptotic equivalence of REM and FEM is analytically proved for linear symplectic maps with random perturbations. For a given map, the REM plot provides a picture of the dynamic stability regions in the phase space, very easy to obtain for any kind of perturbation and very simple to implement numerically. The REM and FEM for linear symplectic maps are proved to be asymptotically equivalent. The global error growth follows a power law in the regions of integrable (or quasi integrable) motion and an exponential law in the regions of chaotic motion. We prove that the power law exponent is 3/2 for a generic anisochronous system, but drops down to 1/2 if the system is isochronous. Correspondingly the Fidelity F(t) exhibits an exponential decay and −lnF(t) grows just as the square of the FEM or REM error. The Reversibility Error and Fidelity can be used for a quantitative analysis of dynamical systems and are suited to investigate the transition regions from chaotic to regular motion even for Hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom such as the N-body problem.},

  abstract   = {This article describes the development, commissioning and operation of a Fill-Pattern Monitor (FPM) for the Australian Synchrotron that measures the real-time intensity distribution of the electron bunches in the storage ring. Using a combination of an ultra-fast photodiode and a high-speed digitiser, real-time measurement of the fill-pattern at bunch-by-bunch resolution was achieved. The results compare very well with current methods of measuring the fill-pattern, such as a pick-up style detector. In addition, the FPM is fully integrated into the EPICS control system. The data provided by the FPM gives accurate RF bucket position and relative bunch currents over a wide range of stored beam currents, from 0.01mA in a single bunch to 200mA total beam current. The FPM monitors the success of an injection attempt into the storage ring and is used in a feedback loop to determine where to target the next injection. Using the FPM a beam top-up mode was successfully tested, resulting in a near constant beam current by periodic targeted injections over an 8h shift. Results are presented for dynamically topped up real-time injection, where the beam pattern was squared using an intensity-dependent injection algorithm.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a new, simple and efficient method for determining the ordered or chaotic nature of orbits in two-dimensional (2D), four-dimensional (4D) and six-dimensional (6D) symplectic maps: the computation of the alignment indices. For a given orbit we follow the evolution in time of two different initial deviation vectors computing the norms of the difference d− (parallel alignment index) and the addition d+ (antiparallel alignment index) of the two vectors. The time evolution of the smaller alignment index reflects the chaotic or ordered nature of the orbit. In 2D maps the smaller alignment index tends to zero for both ordered and chaotic orbits but with completely different time rates, which allows us to distinguish between the two cases. In 4D and 6D maps the smaller alignment index tends to zero in the case of chaotic orbits, while it tends to a positive non-zero value in the case of ordered orbits. The efficiency of the new method is also shown in a case of weak chaos and a comparison with other known methods that separate chaotic from regular orbits is presented.}

  abstract = {We investigate the detailed dynamics of multi-dimensional Hamiltonian systems by studying the evolution of volume elements formed by unit deviation vectors about their orbits. The behavior of these volumes is strongly influenced by the regular or chaotic nature of the motion, the number of deviation vectors, their linear (in)dependence and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. The different time evolution of these volumes can be used to identify rapidly and efficiently the nature of the dynamics, leading to the introduction of quantities that clearly distinguish between chaotic behavior and quasiperiodic motion on N-dimensional tori. More specifically we introduce the Generalized Alignment Index of order k (GALIk) as the volume of a generalized parallelepiped, whose edges are k initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors with respect to the orbit studied whose magnitude is normalized to unity at every time step. We show analytically and verify numerically on particular examples of N-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems that, for chaotic orbits, GALIk tends exponentially to zero with exponents that involve the values of several Lyapunov exponents. In the case of regular orbits, GALIk fluctuates around non-zero values for 2≤k≤N and goes to zero for N<k≤2N following power laws that depend on the dimension of the torus and the number m of deviation vectors initially tangent to the torus: ∝t−2(k−N)+m if 0≤m<k−N, and ∝t−(k−N) if m≥k−N. The GALIk is a generalization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) (GALI2∝SALI). However, GALIk provides significantly more detailed information on the local dynamics, allows for a faster and clearer distinction between order and chaos than SALI and works even in cases where the SALI method is inconclusive.}

We obtain theoretically and verify numerically asymptotic estimates of GALIs long-time behavior in the case of regular orbits lying on low-dimensional tori. The GALIk indices are applied to rapidly detect chaotic oscillations, identify low-dimensional tori of Fermi--Pasta--Ulam (FPU) lattices at low energies and predict weak diffusion away from quasiperiodic motion, long before it is actually observed in the oscillations.}

We emphasize the advantages of these methods in studying the global dynamics of a system, as well as their ability to identify regular motion on low dimensional tori. Finally we discuss several applications of these indices to problems originating from different scientific fields like celestial mechanics, galactic dynamics, accelerator physics and condensed matter physics.}

  abstract     = {Celestial and beam dynamics are similar and share the same methods for the stability analysis. The perturbation theory is the main analytical tool and its version for the symplectic maps, which describe the transverse motion in circular accelerators, are the Birkhoff normal forms. They allow to evaluate the dynamic aperture when the frequency is close to an unstable resonance and to estimate the stability time when it is far from low order resonances. In celestial mechanics the numerical analysis of stability is usually based on the Lyapunov error (for instance, the Fast Lyapunov Indicator). In the case of symplectic maps the forward and reversibility errors induced by random perturbations have been proposed. The use of non-resonant normal forms allows to establish the power law asymptotic behavior of errors with the corresponding pre-factors. The error plots in a phase plane, obtained by fixing the missing coordinates, allow to establish the stability properties of each orbit. The reversibility error due to round-off jointly with the Lyapunov error provide an adequate stability pattern for the H{\'e}non map and their use is suggested for more realistic models such as the one turn map in a ring.},

After an illustration of the basic ideas in a simple hamiltonian model, the dynamics of a charged particle in the magnetic lattice of an accelerator is considered and it is shown to be conveniently described by a symplectic map. After recalling the basic properties of the Birkhoff normal forms, we state a general theorem on the stability of the orbits and sketch the proof. The factorial divergence of the Birkhoff series appears to arise from nonlinearity as well as from the divisors, and a functional equation with interesting analytic properties is obtained from the majorant series.}

  abstract  = {{The dynamic aperture (DA) of a hadron accelerator is represented by the volume in phase space that exhibits bounded motion, where we disregard any disconnected parts that could be due to stable islands. To estimate DA in numerical simulations, it is customary to sample a set of initial conditions using a polar grid in the transverse planes, featuring a limited number of angles and using evenly distributed radial amplitudes. This method becomes very CPU intensive when detailed scans in 4D, and even more in higher dimensions, are used to compute the dynamic aperture. In this paper, a new method is presented, in which the border of the phase-space stable region is identified using a machine learning (ML) model. This allows one to optimise the computational time by taking the complex geometry of the phase space into account, using adaptive sampling to increase the density of initial conditions along the border of stability.}}

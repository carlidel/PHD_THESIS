\section{LHC beam-beam wire compensators fundamentals}

One of the most significant limits in the present LHC design and future HL-LHC design is given by the electromagnetic interactions between the two counter-rotating beams in the shared sections of the machine, the interaction points~\cite{Arduini_2016}. These interactions lead to the so-called \textit{beam-beam effects}, and can be distinguished as head-on beam-beam effects, which occurs when the beam bunches are overlapping in the interaction point, and long-range beam-beam effects, caused by having the two beams close together for the whole length of the shared region.

In the LHC, the beams are set in collision with a small \textit{crossing angle}, which has both the purpose of separating bunches immediately upstream and downstream of the collision point~\cite{Arduini_2016} and to reduce the presence of long-range beam-beam effects, since smaller angles imply smaller beam separation. However, an increase in crossing angle also implies a reduction in integrated luminosity, that is, the total number of collisions that have occurred over a given period of time, typically measured in inverse femtobarns \SI{}{fb}$^{-1}$~\cite{Herr:941318}, as the bunches overlap decreases. A schematic visualization of two different crossing angles and their consequent effect on beam separation and bunch overlap is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:crossing-angles}. The nominal full crossing angle for the LHC is set at $\theta_c =$ \SI{285}{\micro\radian}, while for HL-LHC the expected baseline parameter will be set at $\theta_c =$ \SI{500}{\micro\radian}~\cite{BejarAlonso:2749422}.

The long-range beam-beam effects are also more significant in the second case.}

\end{figure}

To address long-range beam beam effects, while maintaining a small crossing angle, a corrective approach based on electromagnet lenses was presented in~\cite{Koutchouk:692058}. The core concept of this approach is to compensate for the perturbation pattern given by long-range effects by using DC wires. The idea of using DC wires specifically comes from the observation that these long-range effects were similar to the $1/r$ dependence similar to the electric field potential given by a simple wire~\cite{PhysRevSTAB.5.074001}. A sketch of the concept of compensation given by the BBCW is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:wire-baseline}.

The long-range beam-beam effects (red arrow) are compensated by the DC wires (green arrow), which are placed in the beam path before and after the interaction point.}

\end{figure}

The resulting tool is referred to as \textit{``beam-beam wire compensator''} (BBCW), and it has been tested in multiple iterations on various accelerator complexes (a complete list of experimental applications up to early 2022 is available in~\cite{axel.wires}).

In the LHC, the BBCW are installed for Beam~2 only, as it was the only beam that was expected to operate with a coronograph~\cite{Goldblatt:2313940}, which is a device that is expected to allow transverse beam halo measurements in the future. The wires are embedded in the tertiary collimators placed before and after IP1 and IP5~\cite{Rossi:2696270}. These collimators are still part of the collimator hierarchy, presented in Section~\ref{sec:collimation}, with the primary and secondary components placed in IR3 and IR7, and are placed near the IPs to locally protect the experiments from potentially damaging losses.

A collimator hosts two separate wires (one per jaw), and each wire can carry up to \SI{350}{\ampere}. These two separate wires are cabled in series so that they have the same polarity. This configuration enables a specific 2-jaw powering setup with the characteristics of doubling the odd multipolar strength of the kick, while the even ones cancel out. This choice is motivated by the need to compensate for octupolar resonances~\cite{Poyet:2703503}. The two possible configurations are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:wire-configs}. The first one, called the \textit{single wire} configuration, only powers up the internal wires. The second one, referred to as \textit{quadrupolar configuration}, powers up both wires.

\section{Overview of experimental data}

For the application of our diffusive framework, we consider the experimental data gathered at the CERN LHC during the 2018 LHC Machine Development (MD) programme, during the BBCW measurements campaign~\cite{Poyet:2703503}. More specifically, we consider the data gathered during fill 7386, as it has the configuration closest to an operational scenario.

During this MD measurement, the BBCW prototypes installed for Beam~2 were tested in various long-range beam-beam dominated scenarios. Starting from low intensity fills for validating the BBCW configuration, up to high-intensity fills, such as the one we are considering. 

During fill 7386, three trains of symmetric bunches were tested at flat top energy with beams colliding at different crossing angles, smaller than the nominal one in order to have strong long-range beam-beam effects. During this operational-like fill, the wire compensators were set in the quadrupolar configuration. The loss signals measured by the BLMs for the two beams are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:wire-data}, note that the measurement unit is in \SI{}{protons \per s}, as we are considering calibrated losses. Along with the BLM data, the beam intensity measured by the BCTs, the wire power, the octupole power, and the crossing angles are also reported. 

\begin{figure}[hpt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{5_wire_compensators_LHC/figs/wire_summary.pdf}
    \caption{Overview of the data gathered during fill 7386. BLM calibrated losses and BCT beam intensity measurements were taken at different combinations of crossing angles, wire power, and octupole power.}
    \label{fig:wire-data}
\end{figure}

The BLM data for Beam~1 and Beam~2 in units of \SI{}{protons \per s} represents a high-precision measure of protons lost over time. Instead, the BCT data provide a measurement of the intensity of the beam in number of protons over time. Such measurement is not particularly precise, and, qualitatively, it can be seen from the plot how the intensity measured does not distinguish the different regimes of losses highlighted by the BLM data, and maintains a steady linear decrease. This difference in precision makes the BLM data a fundamental tool for inspecting the different regimes of losses in the transverse plane.  

BBCW and octupole magnets power state is reported in Ampere units.  BBCW wires can be found in either an \textit{off} state, namely at \SI{0}{\ampere}, or in an \textit{on} state, namely at \SI{350}{\ampere}. Instead, the octupoles are found at two different amperage values, namely $260$ and \SI{-560}{\ampere}. It is important to highlight how the switch of state for both systems is not instantaneous but requires instead a non-negligible amount of time; this will be thoroughly discussed in the next section.

It is possible to see how the data provide a various number of crossing angle configurations, along with on-off alternations of both BBCW power and octupoles current. Qualitatively, one can see how the BBCW equipped in Beam~2 do lead to a lower BLM loss signal when they are turned on, while turning them off leads to a strong peak in the losses measured by the BLMs.

We will now discuss how our diffusive framework can be applied to this loss signal, along with some necessary considerations on how one must preprocess and interpret these data, before applying the model. 

\section{Application of the diffusive model}

Let us consider the Fokker-Planck equation presented in Eq.~\eqref{eq:fp}, with the Nekhoroshev-like functional diffusion coefficient of Eq.~\eqref{eq:diffusion}. We recall that the system is fully characterized by the three free parameters $\epsilon$, $I_\ast$, and $\kappa$.

To apply this model to the BLM data and reconstruct $D(I)$ for the various states of the system, we perform a fitting approach inspired by the procedure used in the work of Bazzani et al.~\cite{bazzani2020diffusion}, where the same Fokker-Planck model is used to reconstruct the normalized intensity of the beam, evaluated over the number of turns.

Starting from the BLM and BCT data we have at hand, we want to construct a measure of the normalized intensity of the beam over the number of turns. To archive this, we first convert the measurements from seconds to the number of turns, considering that in LHC Run2, a reference proton at \SI{6.5}{TeV} performs 11245 turns every second. To then evaluate the relative intensity lost over an interval $[N_0, N_1]$, as the BCT data are not precise enough to highlight fine differences in loss rates, we consider as the amount of protons lost the integrated BLM signal, and we take the BCT value registered at $N_0=3.5\times10^6$ turns as the reference intensity, as it is the moment at which the first peak in BLM losses was measured. This procedure is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:blm-to-intensity}.

\begin{figure}[hpt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{5_wire_compensators_LHC/figs/stationary_transient_example_chunk.pdf}
    \caption{Example of the procedure used to evaluate the relative intensity lost over an interval $[N_0, N_1]$. The BLM signal is integrated over the interval, and the BCT value registered at $N_0=3.5\times10^6$ turns is used as the reference intensity. A comparison between the integrated losses measured in the stationary state of the chunk and the transient state is also reported. As the losses in the transient state are much lower than the losses in the stationary state, our working hypothesis still holds.}
    \label{fig:blm-to-intensity}
\end{figure}

Along with the various assumptions made to enable the application of the Nekhoroshev estimate, such as the averaging principle on the angular variables, it is important to note that this model has the strong hypothesis that $D(I)$ does not evolve over time. This implies that the magnetic lattice of the accelerator must not manifest stronger variations than the ones given by the small stochastic perturbation. Such a strong assumption requires some preliminary consideration on the BLM loss signal we have at hand.

When the BBCW, the crossing angle, and the octupoles are in a stationary state, we can state that the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation can be considered as constant over time, since the magnetic lattice does not undergo significant variations. We can define this state as stationary and have the beam distribution $\rho(I, t)$ following the evolution defined by the Fokker-Planck equation.

When instead a variation in any of the elements occurs, e.g.\ a BBCW is switched on or the crossing angle is varied, we have the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation will vary as well into a new value. Such variation does not necessarily happen in a negligible time. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:transient-state}, the BBCW DC current being switched on to the target voltage takes a significant number of seconds, leading to a time interval in which the system is undergoing a transient state. During such a transient state, we cannot make assumptions about the evolution of the transverse beam or the evolution of the values of $\epsilon$, $I_\ast$, and $\kappa$, and therefore we are forced to discard these data slices.

\begin{figure}[hpt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{5_wire_compensators_LHC/figs/stationary_transient.pdf}
    \caption{Visualization of the difference between stationary state and transient state for a slice of data. We define as stationary state the time interval in which all the parameters of the system are in a steady state, while the transient state is the time interval in which the system is undergoing a variation. Here, the BBCW DC current is switched on to the target voltage, causing a transient state along the process.}
    \label{fig:transient-state}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:chunks}, we show the BLM data for Beam~1 and Beam~2 divided into enumerated chunks where the system is in the stationary state. We can see how the stationary states are generally longer than the transient states, except for the part where the octupoles change state.

\begin{figure}[hpt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{5_wire_compensators_LHC/figs/chunks_names.pdf}
    \caption{Experimental data of Beam~2 divided in chunks, where each chunk is in a stationary state. Each chunk is characterized by a different set of parameters, and the system is in a transient state when the parameters are changed. Each chunk has a number assigned, which will be used to identify it for the rest of the analysis. Red corresponds to stationary state data, while black represents transient state data.}
    \label{fig:chunks}
\end{figure}

We assume that the beam distribution at the end of a stationary state can be used as the initial condition of the next stationary state. Therefore, we completely neglect the transient state losses between the two stationary states. To justify this approach, however, we must know that the integrated loss in the transient state must not be significantly comparable to the integrated loss in the stationary state.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:wire_loss_comp}, this comparison is shown for each individual chunk, and it is possible to see how the interval where the octupole state is changed has higher relative transient losses. Such comparable losses led us to the decision not to inspect this chunk of data characterized by varying octupoles, and we performed our fitting procedure only to the data up to those variations.

\begin{figure}[hpt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{5_wire_compensators_LHC/figs/losses_comparison.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison of the integrated losses in transient state and in stationary state for each chunk of data. The chunk numbers follow the nomenclature defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:chunks}. A higher relative loss in the transient states can be seen for the chunk where the octupoles are changed.}
    \label{fig:wire_loss_comp}
\end{figure}

Now that we have defined the data we will use for the fitting procedure, we can define the initial beam distribution we will use for the fitting. We consider a Gaussian beam distribution with unitary $\sigma$, which in action variables reads as a negative exponential distribution $\rho_0(I) = \exp(-I)$. To fit the data, we use the same procedure as in the work of Bazzani et al.~\cite{bazzani2020diffusion}, that is, we scan the values $\kappa$ and $I_\ast$, and integrate the evolution of the FP equation over the number of turns. The $\epsilon^2$ parameter is then fixed by requiring that the initial and final values of the relative intensity, evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the chunk, are equal.

As we assume that the beam distribution at the end of a stationary state can be used as the initial condition of the next stationary state, we can use the evolved beam distribution as the initial condition for the next chunk. This procedure, iterated for all chunks, finally gives us the reconstructed $D(I)$ for the various states of the system.

\section{Numerical results}

We performed the fitting procedure for the data of both Beam~1 and Beam~2. As the wires are installed on Beam~2 only, we do not expect to observe a significant difference between $D(I)$ reconstructed on the Beam~1 chunks with wire on and wire off. However, the data of Beam~1 is useful for both understanding the effects of different crossing angles on the system and establishing the characteristics of the results provided by the fitting procedure.

\subsection*{Beam~1 data}

We first consider the data of Beam~1 divided in chunks only where the crossing angle is varied. In Fig.~\ref{fig:reconstruction_1}, we show the relative intensity loss, along with the fit reconstruction. Note that we considered Beam~1 data up to the point at which the octupole current is varied. In Fig.~\ref{fig:reconstruction_2}, we show the reconstructed $D(I)$ for the various crossing angles.

We can see how $D(I)$ increases as the crossing angle is lowered, as expected from the fact that long-range beam-beam effects are more important, and we can also observe how in general the fitting procedure manages to reproduce the data quite well. %The evolution of the three parameters, $\epsilon$, $I_\ast$, and $\kappa$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameters_1}. No significant patterns can be observed in the evolution of the parameters.%; however, the resulting $D(I)$ given by the three parameters increases as the crossing angle is lowered.

%    \label{fig:parameters_1}
%\end{figure}

If we instead consider the data of Beam~1 divided in chunks where the wire compensators are switched on and off, we can see how the $D(I)$ reconstructed, presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:reconstruction_3}, while manifesting differences, does not show a consistent different diffusion value between the two states. Moreover, extreme differences are also obtained from the $D(I)$ reconstructed from the full chunk also at lower $I$ values. This suggests that the fitting procedure might be affected by overfitting when the chunks are too small and not rich enough in information.

A comparison of the $\chi^2$ values of the fit for the two different chunking methods is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:chi2}. We can see that the $\chi^2$ values are mostly lower when smaller chunks are considered, but not consistently. This suggests that, as no consistent differences can be observed in the reconstructed $D(I)$ between the wire-on and wire-off states, and as overfitting issues are observed at some fitting chunks, that, indeed, the BBCW on Beam~2 is not significantly affecting the beam dynamics on Beam~1.

The $D(I)$ does not show a consistent different diffusion value between the two states and, in multiple situations, the values obtained for $D(I)$ on the smaller samples obtain extremely different results from the full fitting result for low values of $I$. This suggests overfitting issues. The numbers follow the nomenclature in Fig.~\ref{fig:chunks}.}

    \label{fig:chi2}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Beam~2 data}

We now inspect the data of Beam~2, where the wires are installed. We consider the data divided in chunks as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:chunks}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:reconstruction_4}, we show the relative intensity loss, along with the fit reconstruction. In Fig.~\ref{fig:reconstruction_5}, we show the reconstructed $D(I)$ for the various crossing angles and the various wire states.

It can be seen that, in general, the fit reconstruction is able to reproduce the data quite well. Furthermore, it is possible to see how the reconstructed $D(I)$ is consistently different when the wires are switched on and off, with generally higher diffusion values when the wires are off. This is in agreement with the expectation that the wires are able to reduce the long-range beam-beam effects and thus the diffusion. Moreover, it is possible to see how such a reconstructed $D(I)$ for wire on states also has lower values for low $I$ amplitudes. This suggests that indeed the BBCWs might provide a better long-term stability of the beam.

The values of the two parameters, $I_\ast$ and $\kappa$, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameters_3}. Also in this case, no significant patterns can be observed in the evolution of the parameters for the different states of the system.

%To quantify the effects of the wires on the long-term beam dynamics, we can take the various reconstructed $D(I)$ for one of the crossing angles and consider the evolution of the relative intensity and emittance of a Gaussian distribution with a Fokker-Planck evolution over a number of turns of a higher order of magnitude. In Fig.~\ref{fig:evolution}, we show the evolution of the relative intensity and emittance for the various $D(I)$ reconstructed for the crossing angle of \SI{150}{\micro\radian}. We can see how the wires are able to archive a lower relative intensity. The emittance appear to decrease faster for cases where $D(I)$ is higher, this is due to the functional shape of $D(I)$ that, we recall, implies a semi-stationary distribution following Eq.~\eqref{}, which can be seen in Fig.~\ref{}. Such distribution describes a slow erosion that implies a reduction in emittance.

The only exception is given by chunk 6, with a crossing angle of $\theta_c=$\SI{150}{\micro\radian}.}

\section{Final remarks}

We have performed an initial study of the effects of the BBCWs on the long-term beam dynamics of the LHC using our diffusive framework. We have used the data of the LHC Beam~1 and Beam~2, taken during an MD measurement campaign of Run2, and we have reconstructed the $D(I)$ of various system configurations. Ultimately, we have found that the wires are able to reduce the long-range beam-beam effects and thus the diffusion. Moreover, we have observed that our model suggests that the wires are consistently able to archive a lower intensity loss. As expected, the model did not highlight significant BBCWs effects on Beam~1.

As pointed out in the overview of the experimental data, a large portion of the data had to be discarded because of the large amount of losses occurring during transient periods. Moreover, multiple chunks considered in the analysis are characterized by a very short time span, which might be too short to be representative of the long-term beam dynamics. This is a limitation of the data that might have had a significant impact on the results.

However, the promising results obtained in the fit reconstruction seem to suggest that this diffusive framework can provide some insight into the long-term effects of BBCWs on beam dynamics. This has motivated us to consider a different data gathering strategy for the scheduled MD measurements of LHC Run3. More specifically, we planned to measure the BLM losses while keeping the BBCWs on and off for longer time spans, in order to better characterize the long-term effects of the wires.

Additionally, we planned to perform collimation scans with BBCWs on and off, in order to directly inspect the beam tail population and measure $D(I)$ following the protocol presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:probing}. The purpose was to compare the values obtained with the two different methodologies.

Both of these strategies in the data gathering have been successfully implemented during the MD measurement campaign of LHC Run3~\cite{}, and the results will be presented in a future work.

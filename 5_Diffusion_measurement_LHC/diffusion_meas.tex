\section{The LHC collimation system}

The layout of the LHC~\cite{Bruning:782076} can be summarized in a geometrical scheme composed by 8 straight Insertion Regions (IRs) and 8 circular arc segments. A simple scheme of this layout is reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc_layout}. Within this circular scheme, the main particle physics experiments are located in IR1, IR2, IR5, and IR8, namely, ATLAS~\cite{TheATLASCollaboration_2008}, ALICE~\cite{Alessandro:879894}, CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:1129810}, and LHCb~\cite{Alves:1129809}. In these four IRs, the two beams intersect and interact in what is referred to as an Interaction Point (IP). The RF cavities for accelerating the beams are in IR4 and IR6 hosts the beam extraction system. Finally, IR3 and IR7 are dedicated, respectively, to the longitudinal and transverse collimation system.

The LHC collimation system is a fundamental component to the machine operation and security~\cite{1590664, Assmann:972336}. It has multiple functions, such as cleaning the beam halo, protecting the machine for expected and anomalous losses~\cite{BRUCE201719}, and reducing the background noise at the experiments IPs~\cite{Bruce:1646958, Bruce:2686581}.

The collimation system counts more than 120 individual collimators. The majority of these collimators are movable devices constituted by two movable jaws made of solid material, which can be brought at different distances from the circulating beam~\cite{Bertarelli:794628}. These jaws are straight and parallel to the beam and have a tapering on both ending sides, along the axis of the beam. The distance between the start and end of the tapering, where the jaw material is straight, is referred to as the active length of the collimator. Some photos and schemes of these LHC collimators are reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:collimator_pics}.

    \label{fig:collimator_pics}
\end{figure}

At IR7, where transversal collimators are located, we have an effective cleaning stage of halo particles that happen to have and excessively large betatron oscillation. In this precise region, the magnetic lattice optics is configured so that we can observe a maximum separation for such particles (i.e.\ the $\beta$ function for this region is kept particularly large). A cleaning of particles with large longitudinal deviations happens instead in IR3, where additional horizontal dispersion is introduced to translate the momentum defect of the halo particles into a physical trajectory deviation.

In IR7, there are 3 sets of collimators covering the horizontal, vertical and skew planes. In IR3, the dispersion is only in the horizontal and only one set of collimators is installed.

To safely clean the beam halo without damaging the magnets or other components of the machine, the LHC collimation systems follows a multi-stage process. This multi-stage process consists of a \textit{hierarchy} of individual collimators with the purpose to progressively clean and channel the particle loss. A scheme of this hierarchy is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:collimator_hierarchy}.

    \caption{Scheme of the multistage collimation system inside the LHC. The hierarchy includes primary (TCP), secondary (TCSG) and tertiary (TCT) collimators and shower absorbers (TCLA). Particles from the primary halo collide with the TCP and are scattered to the TCSGs. The hadronic showers coming from the TCSGs are finally absorbed by the TCLAs, and TCTs are in place to protect the aperture bottlenecks. Part of the secondary halo interacts with the ionization chambers of the BLMs, and provide an indirect measurement of the primary halo. (Scheme based on Ref.~\cite{Hermes:2241364})}
    \label{fig:collimator_hierarchy}
\end{figure}

The primary collimators, which are also referred to as \textit{Target Collimator Primary} (TCP), are the ones placed the closest to the beam and form the first stage of collimation. The purpose of this first collimation stage is to intercept and dispose of beam halo particles, i.e.\ it is the stage at which the beam halo actually gets intercepted above a certain threshold. When interacting with the primary collimators matter, the particles may exhibit various scattering behaviours ranging from acquiring an angular kick, to depositing energy, and producing secondary particles. 

These particles, scattered by the TCPs, form the secondary halo, which is then tackled by the secondary collimators, \textit{Target Collimator Secondary-Graphite} (TCSG). The particles leaving the collimator finally form the tertiary halo, which finally interacts with the active absorbers, \textit{Target Collimator Long Absorber} (TCLA), which are installed downstream of the TCSGs, and \textit{Target Collimator Tertiarys} (TCTs), which make up a final third collimation stage for local protection for the aperture bottlenecks in the machine.

The secondary particle showers represent the point of observation for measuring the amount of particles lost at the TCPs. To quantify this amount, the LHC is equipped with multiple ionization chambers, with constitute the Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) system~\cite{blmSystem1, blmSystem2}. The charged particles traversing the ionization chambers finally provide a measure of \SI{}{Gy \per s}, which can be converted into a corresponding measure of \SI{}{p \per s} lost using a calibration factor, evaluated via controlled collimator-induced losses~\cite{arek}. A picture of an LHC BLM is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:blm}. This calibrated BLM data is the precise loss signal that we finally expect to use for reconstructing the diffusion behaviour in the transverse plane.

\section{Analysis of experimental data}

Between 2016 and 2018, collimator scans were performed at the CERN LHC with physics beams at \SI{6.5}{TeV}~\cite{PhysRevAccelBeams.23.044802}. During these scans, one of the jaws of the IR7 primary collimators was moved inwards and outwards in small steps, starting at $~5\sigma$. The scan was performed after a beam-based alignment~\cite{valentino2012semiautomatic} of the collimator to centre it precisely around the local closed orbit.

The measurement is performed with the local beam loss monitoring (BLM) system, and is provided in unit of \SI{}{Gy \per s} with \SI{1}{Hz} sampling rate, processed over different running sums (RS)~\cite{Bruning:782076}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:first} we present a portion of the data collected in fill 6052 of type RS06, i.e.\ sampling the maximum spike measured by the BLM over a time window of \SI{10.24}{ms}. The measured collimator jaw position is converted to measured beam sigma units using the nominal optical parameters and the measured value of the beam emittance, taking into account the position of the beam centre.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim={0 2.5mm 0 4mm}, clip, width=\textwidth]{5_Diffusion_measurement_LHC/figs/first.pdf}
    \caption{Beam losses from the BLM monitor (i.e.\ the maximum spike over a time window of \SI{10.24}{ms}) and jaw positions measured in the vertical plane for the collimator scans carried out in fill 6052. The data shown correspond to outward jaw movements. The yellow-marked region of interest (ROI) represents a subset of data meeting our quality requirements~\cite{PhysRevAccelBeams.23.044802}.}
    \label{fig:first}
\end{figure}


A calibration factor $F$~\cite{arek} dependent on the jaw position was considered for converting BLM data expressed as \SI{}{Gy \per s} to \SI{}{protons \per s} beam loss data. This calibration factor $F$ was calculated from the BLM loss data and the intensity lost recorded by the DC beam current transformer during the collimator steps, and reads $F = \left(-9.0\times10^{-14}\sigma + 6.2\times10^{-13}\right)^{-1}$.

It should be stressed that these older collimator scans were not performed using the new procedure~\cite{our_paper9}, as complete inward scans, followed by outward scans, were used instead of a sequence of in/out steps. To address the lack of alternating jaw movements, we selected a region of interest (ROI) in which a large number of outward steps were performed with almost regular sampling. Next, we built $J_\text{eq}^{\text{est}}(t)$ with a single CSI passing through the terminating points of the sequence of outward recovery currents. This fundamental CSI has been multiplied by a constant term to represent different possible levels of partial recovery of $J_\mathrm{R}(t)$. This is needed because the jaw movements were not always performed to allow enough time for the system to relax to its equilibrium state. This procedure is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:second}.

    \caption{Estimates of $J_\mathrm{eq}(t)$ for Beam~1 data. An initial estimate is made with a CSI with positive second derivative passing through the end points of the measured recovery currents. The various curves are obtained by multiplying the fundamental CSI by a constant term, and represent estimates of the partial recovery currents.}
    \label{fig:second}
\end{figure}
%

To cope with the rapid sequence of jaw movements, we replace the integral terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:difference} with the approximation
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{\mathrm{app}}^{*}(I)= \begin{cases} -M & \text { if } I\leq I_{\mathrm{a}}\\ -\left(\frac{I_{\mathrm{a}}^{\prime }-I}{I_{\mathrm{a}}^{ \prime}-I_{\mathrm{a}}}\right) M & \text { if } I>I_{\mathrm{a}} \, , \end{cases} 
\end{equation}
where $M$ is a constant fixed for each jaw movement that represents an unknown amount of out-of-equilibrium distribution.
A scan is performed on different combinations of CSI and $M$ values while keeping track of $\chi^2$ achieved by the fitting routine that determines the values of the model parameters $\kappa, I_\ast$. The result of this procedure is shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:fourth} and~\ref{fig:fifth}, where one can observe the existence of an optimal configuration of parameters and the good reconstruction performance achieved by such a configuration. The optimal fit results for Beam~1 and Beam~2 data are reported in Table~\ref{tab:fit_results}.

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Note that the values reported in~\cite{bazzani2020diffusion}, namely $\kappa=0.33 $ and $I_\ast \simeq 21$, were obtained for Beam~2 and considering the diffusion in the vertical plane. It should be stressed that these previous measurements were performed with isolated bunches, whereas in the beam measurements analysed here, beam-beam effects were present.

\section{Conclusions and outlook}
%
A non-linear diffusive model based on Nekhoroshev theorem was used to reconstruct available beam loss data obtained at the  LHC from collimator scans. The differences between the approach used to gather the data and the optimal one suggested by our recent numerical studies required adaptation of some of the key elements of our fitting procedure. Eventually, this led to good reconstruction performances and promising insights into the global diffusive behaviour of the LHC beam halo.

Future research will focus on acquiring beam data using the proposed optimised experimental method to characterise more accurately the presence of nonlinear diffusive behaviour. The new datasets might also be used to perform comparisons between the newly proposed collimator scan method for the Nekhoroshev-based diffusive model and the previous approach based on the linearisation of the diffusion coefficient around a given jaw position.
